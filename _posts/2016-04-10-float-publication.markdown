![MCAD's Fine Arts Booklet]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/float/pg1.jpg)

This publication was created in conjunction with the Float installation. The content of this publication depicts my thought process throughout the creation of the physical piece. The bones of the publication was created in a system following a strict grid, but like the installation the publication introduced moments of intentional stray. These moments are made up of personal inserts of my voice, a secondary visual dialogue if you may.
