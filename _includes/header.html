    <p><b>Joe Letchford</b> is an American graphic designer pursuing his MFA from the <a href="http://www.mcad-mfa.com/">Minneapolis College of Art and Design.</a></p>
    <p>His work focuses predominately in exploring process, collaboration, relational aesthetics and how all that relates to physical spaces. These observations and experimentation attempts, in the physical space or the space of the book, are opportunities to make his exploration concrete, focusing on mental space, ways of thinking, creation processes, as well as, on the results of these efforts.</p>
    <p>Joe’s work has and will always be in a state of flux, one that is constantly changing—maybe not drastically—but certainly always. Always growing from successful and unsuccessful ideas. Re-working the thoughts and sharpening the concepts, Joe is always chiseling out the framework of his methods of production and thought process.  He is constantly working. </p>
